## How do I compile full HCC codebase?

You can find the builds scripts for you platform in the `scripts` directory at the root of project.

Linux:
```
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/build.sh release # to build a release package
```

```
scripts\build.bat
scripts\build.bat release :: to build a release package
```
